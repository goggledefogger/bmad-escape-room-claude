**Analysis:** Limited supplier power due to multiple technology options, but specialized accessibility expertise creates some constraints.

**Factors Increasing Power:**
- Accessibility consulting expertise is specialized and limited
- Content creation talent (writers, designers) can demand premium rates
- Cloud infrastructure providers have oligopoly pricing power

**Factors Decreasing Power:**
- Multiple technology stack options reduce vendor lock-in
